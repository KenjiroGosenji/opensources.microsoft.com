public class Program

        PlayerCharacter player1 = new PlayerCharacter("Erza", Race.Human, 1, true);
        PlayerCharacter player2 = new PlayerCharacter("Zeref", Race.Aasimar, 1, false);
       
        Console.WriteLine($"{player1.Name} is a {player1.Race} at level {player1.Level}. Is he a hero? {player1.IsHero}");
        Console.WriteLine($"{player2.Name} is a {player2.Race} at level {player2.Level}. Is he a hero? {player2.IsHero}");
    }
}

```

This code defines a `PlayerCharacter` class with properties for name, race, level, and hero status. It also includes an enum for the different playable races in the game. In the `Main` method, two player characters are created and their details are displayed in the console. You can expand upon this code to include more game features like combat, quests, and leveling systems.
